Frustrated by the impact of climate change, my group and I explore “seed bombing” as 
an option to increase green initiatives in urban environments. This was submitted to 
the TechTogether NYC hackathon and won Best High School Hack. My main contribution 
to this project was on user interface and on the seed map API.
